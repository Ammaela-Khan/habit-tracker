My Reflection: 

This project helped me apply JavaScript and HTML concepts in a practical, hands-on way. I gained confidence in my coding abilities by running the code, analyzing how it behaved in the browser, and identifying which code segments controlled specific UI elements. By typing and modifying the code section by section, I was able to track my progress and strengthen my understanding of how logic connects to user interface behavior.

I learned about adding ARIA attributes for accessibility, and testing keyboard navigation helped me realize how essential inclusive design is for usability. I also experimented with layout and colors to maintain strong visual contrast and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

Another important lesson was handling state updates efficiently, making sure that the page doesn’t reload for every small user action. For example, when marking a day as complete, the app updates dynamically instead of refreshing the entire page, creating a smoother experience.

Overall, this project deepened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and UX design principles. It improved my ability to structure code clearly and maintainably. I’m proud of the result and see this project as a strong foundation for building more complex and dynamic web applications in the future.
